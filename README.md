# MATLAB-switch-statement-
Rewrite the following nested if-else statement as a switch statement in script that accomplishes exactly the same thing. Assume that num is an integer variable that has been initialized, and that there are functions f1, f2, f3, and f4. Do not use any if or if-else statements in the actions in the switch statement, only calls to the four functions.
